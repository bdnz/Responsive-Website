          <p>Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. 
            Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and 
            the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side.
             The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of
              around 15.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest
               European city.
Founded under the name of Byzantion (Βυζάντιον) on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BCE, the city developed to become 
one of the most significant in history. After its reestablishment as Constantinople in 330 CE, it served as an imperial capital 
for almost 16 centuries, during the Roman and Byzantine (330–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin (1204–1261), and the Ottoman (1453–1922) 
empires.It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times, 
before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453
